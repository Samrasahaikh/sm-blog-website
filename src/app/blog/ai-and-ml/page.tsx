      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-4 fade-in">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 fade-in">
       {` Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve in ways that mimic human cognition. AI encompasses a broad range of technologies, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, expert systems, and more. AI systems are designed to analyze large datasets, make decisions, and automate processes with minimal human intervention.`}
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 fade-in">
        {`One of the most well-known applications of AI is virtual assistants, like Siri or Alexa, that use voice recognition and NLP to respond to user commands. Other examples include self-driving cars, predictive analytics in healthcare, fraud detection in banking, and AI-powered chatbots in customer service.`}
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 fade-in">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 fade-in">
        {`Machine Learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. Unlike traditional programming, where rules are explicitly defined by developers, ML algorithms "learn" from data without being explicitly programmed.`}
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 fade-in">
        There are several types of Machine Learning:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside fade-in">
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input. This type of learning is commonly used for classification tasks like image recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns and relationships. Clustering and anomaly detection are typical applications of unsupervised learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken, and adjusting its behavior accordingly. This type of learning is used in game AI and robotics.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 fade-in">Applications of AI and ML</h2>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside fade-in">
          <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> AI systems rely on vast amounts of data, raising concerns about user privacy and data security.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Machine learning algorithms can perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Automation powered by AI may lead to job losses in certain industries, raising concerns about unemployment and the future of work.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> AI decisions need to be explainable, and there should be accountability in case of mistakes or harm caused by AI systems.</li>
